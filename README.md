# Healthy Leaf

Healthy Leaf (HL) introduces an innovative approach to plant care through Smart Image Analysis (SIA). This project aims to alleviate the challenges associated with identifying potential diseases (PD) in plants and providing appropriate solutions. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, HL offers a Solutions Adviser (SA) platform where users can upload pictures for Picture Upload and Analysis (POC). The platform analyzes images to determine PD and gives the user information about the disease and its cure.
